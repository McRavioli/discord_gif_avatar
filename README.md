# discord_gif_avatar
This Python script allows you to change your bot's avatar to a GIF. It also works with other file formats, but it was specifically designed for GIFs since you can only change a bot's avatar to a GIF through the API.

## Instructions:
1. Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual bot token.
2. Specify the path to the file you'd like to use as the bot's avatar.
3. Install discord.py if you haven't already by typing 'pip install discord' in your terminal.
4. Execute the 'discord_gif_avatar.py' file.
5. When the terminal outputs "Bot's avatar changed successfully!", your bot's avatar should be updated.
